Clarity - a log search tool
By John Tajima & Tobi LÃ¼tke
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clarity is an eventmachine-based web application that is used at Shopify to
search log files on production servers.

We wrote Clarity to allow authorized users to use a simple interface to look
through the various log files in our server farm, without requiring access to
production servers.

Clarity requires eventmachine and eventmachine/evma_httpserver.

  sudo gem install eventmachine eventmachine_httpserver
